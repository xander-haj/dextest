# Obsidian Continue Plugin

This plugin adds an AI-powered command that can continue selected text inside Obsidian. It uses OpenAI's completion API. Configure your API key in the plugin settings, select some text, and run the command **Continue Selection with AI** to generate the continuation.

## Build

Run `npm install` to install development dependencies and then `npm run build` to compile the plugin. The compiled file will be generated in `dist/main.js`.
